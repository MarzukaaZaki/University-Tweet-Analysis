## Introduction
This project investigates how universities have communicated about diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) over time on X (formerly, Twitter). Using over 8 million tweets from five university accounts spanning 2010â€“2022, I applied natural language processing techniques to classify tweets as DEI-related or not. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I performed exploratory analysis to understand the linguistic and thematic differences between DEI and non-DEI tweets, and to uncover general patterns within the dataset.

### Histogram
Tweet volume from US universities (2010-2022) shows strong initial growth, peaking around 2014-2015, followed by a consistent decline in subsequent years.
